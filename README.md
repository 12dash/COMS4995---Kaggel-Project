While the traditional image classification task deals with classifying a single object in an image, in this competition we focus on hierarchical labeling of an entity in the image. In our hierarchical classification task, an image belongs to a superclass and subclass. In this paper, we implemented and analyzed three approaches: computing direct probabilities, fine-tuning a CNN with multiple heads, and an encoder-decoder architecture. We found the multi-head CNN to perform the best on the held-out test set. We also exploited attention layers of the decoder to interpret the model. <br>

This repository contains the released data and code for all the three methods listed in the report.

* Independent Probability Approach
* CNN Multi-Head Model
* Encoder-Decoder Architecture
  * CNN-RNN 
  * CNN-Transformers
